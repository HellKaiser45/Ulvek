similarity_search_description = """‚ö†Ô∏è EXPENSIVE TOOL - Use only when absolutely necessary ‚ö†Ô∏è
    
    Performs semantic similarity search across code chunks using AI embeddings.
    This is a HIGH-COST operation that should be your LAST RESORT after trying
    lightweight alternatives like ripgrep or file structure analysis.
    
    üî¥ WHEN TO USE:
    - You need to find conceptually similar code (not exact patterns)
    - You're looking for implementations of abstract concepts
    - You need to understand how a specific algorithm/pattern is implemented
    - Ripgrep and file structure search have failed to find what you need
    
    üö´ WHEN NOT TO USE:
    - Looking for exact strings, function names, or imports ‚Üí use ripgrep
    - Understanding project structure or file relationships ‚Üí use file structure tools
    - Finding error messages or logs ‚Üí use ripgrep  
    - Exploring a new codebase ‚Üí start with file structure + ripgrep
    - You already have sufficient context to answer the user's question
    
    Args:
        question (str): A focused, specific semantic search query. 
            ‚úÖ GOOD: "authentication middleware that handles JWT tokens"
            ‚úÖ GOOD: "error handling patterns for database connections" 
            ‚úÖ GOOD: "how user permissions are validated"
            ‚ùå BAD: "how does this work" (too vague)
            ‚ùå BAD: "authentication" (too broad, use ripgrep instead)
            ‚ùå BAD: "show me the code" (not semantic)
            
        paths (list[str] | None): Restrict search to specific directories/files.
            ‚úÖ GOOD: ["src/auth", "src/middleware"] (focused search)
            ‚úÖ GOOD: ["app.py", "main.py"] (specific files)  
            ‚úÖ GOOD: ["src"] (one main directory)
            ‚ùå BAD: ["."] or None (searches entire project - very expensive)
            ‚ùå BAD: ["src", "tests", "docs", "config"] (too broad)
            
            üí° TIP: Use file structure or ripgrep results to identify relevant paths first
            
        limit (int): Maximum chunks to return. Default 5.
            ‚úÖ GOOD: 3-5 for focused searches
            ‚úÖ GOOD: 1-2 if you just need one example
            ‚ùå BAD: 10+ (expensive and usually unnecessary)
            
            üí° TIP: Start with limit=3, increase only if results are insufficient
    
    Returns:
        list[str]: Relevant code chunks with file/chunk metadata banners:
            [FILE: src/auth/middleware.py | CHUNK: 2]
            <actual code content>
            
        str: Error message if results are too large (exceeds token limits)
            ‚Üí Retry with smaller limit or more focused paths
    
    ‚ö° PERFORMANCE NOTES:
    - Cost scales with: (number of files) √ó (file sizes) √ó (semantic complexity)
    - Searching entire project (paths=["."] or None) can be 10-50x more expensive
    - Always prefer targeted searches over broad exploration
    
    üéØ USAGE STRATEGY:
    1. First try: ripgrep for exact patterns, imports, function names
    2. Then try: file structure analysis to understand project layout  
    3. Finally try: similarity_search with focused question + targeted paths (only if needed)
    
    üí° EXPERT TIP: 
    If you're tempted to call this multiple times, you're probably using it wrong.
    One well-crafted call with specific paths should be sufficient.
