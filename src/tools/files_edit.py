    Perform a precise, line-aware edit on an existing file.

    Use this function when you need to:
    â€¢ change a specific substring or block of code

      you want to replace)

    The function performs a literal string replacement and validates that the

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_path : str
        Relative or absolute path to the file.  If relative, it is resolved
        against the current working directory.
    old_string : str
        Exact substring to locate in the current file content.  Leading/trailing
        whitespace and newlines are significant.
    new_string : str
        Replacement text to insert in place of `old_string`.
    expected_replacements : int, default 1
        Number of times `old_string` must appear for the edit to succeed.
        Set to 0 to allow creation of a new file (in which case `old_string`
        must be empty).
