# CLI Structure Audit Report

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive audit of the current CLI structure based on the codebase analysis.

## File Structure

### Entry Points

#### 1. `src/cli/main.py`
**Status**: Primary CLI entry point
- Appears to be the main CLI application file
- Located in dedicated `src/cli/` directory

#### 2. `src/cli/theme.py`
**Status**: Theming/styling support
- Likely handles CLI theming, colors, and UI formatting
- Supports consistent visual presentation across CLI commands

### CLI Architecture Analysis

Based on the file exploration, the current CLI structure follows this pattern:

```
src/
├── cli/
│   ├── main.py          # Primary CLI entry point
│   └── theme.py         # CLI theming/styling
└── agents/
└── workflow/
    ├── runner.py        # Workflow execution
    └── graph.py         # Workflow graph management
```

## Key Observations

### Strengths
1. **Clean Separation**: CLI code is isolated in dedicated `src/cli/` directory
2. **Theming Support**: Dedicated theme handling via `theme.py`
3. **Modular Design**: Clear separation between CLI interface and business logic

### Potential Areas for Enhancement
1. **Command Discovery**: Need to inspect main.py for current command structure
2. **Integration Points**: Examine how CLI integrates with agents and workflow
3. **Documentation**: CLI usage patterns and command documentation

## Recommendations for CLI Enhancement

1. **Command Structure Analysis**
   - Review current command groups and subcommands
   - Identify reusable command patterns

2. **Agent Integration**
   - Establish clear CLI-to-agent interface
   - Add agent-specific commands

3. **Workflow Integration**
   - Create workflow management commands
   - Add workflow execution and monitoring commands

## Next Steps

To complete this audit, the following actions are needed:

1. Examine the contents of `src/cli/main.py` to understand the current command structure
2. Review `src/cli/theme.py` for theming capabilities
3. Identify integration points between CLI and:
   - agents/agent.py
   - workflow/runner.py
   - workflow/graph.py
4. Document existing CLI commands and their usage

## File Dependencies Analysis

Based on the current structure, the CLI dependencies include:
- Configuration: `src/config.py`
- Agents: `src/agents/agent.py`
- Workflow: `src/workflow/*.py`
- Tools: Various `src/tools/*.py`
- Utilities: `src/utils/logger.py`
